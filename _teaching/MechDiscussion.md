From August 2018 to January 2020, I was a teaching assistant for multiple introductory physics courses. As part of these courses, students would also have to attend weekly "Discussion Sections" in groups of 20-30, led by a TA (me). I would present the students with problems related to the most recent lecture, and task them to finding the answer in small groups. I would monitor the students and provide help when stuck. Additionally, I would try and build a professional relationship with the students to raise their engagement level with the course. From my own experience, discussion sections with personable and friendly TAs motivated me to remain engaged.

While students were only assigned to one discussion section, the lectures often had enough to fill many. I led three per week on average.

Additionally, I hosted office hours once per week where any of my students could come and ask me for help on anything class-related.
