From August 2018 to January 2020, I was a teaching assistant for multiple introductory physics courses. As part of these courses, students would also have to attend weekly laboratory sessions in groups of ~20, led by a TA (me). I would present a physical experiment setup that showcased a principle recently covered in the associated lecture. I would guide the students through the lab worksheets, teaching them proper measuring and recording practices. I also ensured that the students understood the connection between the week's activity and what was taught in lecture. Three to four times per semester, the lab would require a graded writeup. In addition to teaching the labs, I would teach proper formatting techniques, data visualization techniques, and basic scientific writing. Once graded, I would also provide class-wide feedback.

### Examples of Experiments
- Elastic vs. Inelastic Collisions on an Air Table
- Using Kinematic Equations to Predict where a Marble will Land
- Creation of Paper Fan Blades for Testing Fan Blade Profile Efficiency
- Tracking Simple Harmonic Motion using Pendulums and Springs
