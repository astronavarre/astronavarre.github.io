From August 2018 to January 2020, I was a teaching assistant for multiple introductory physics lectures on mechanics. The course was set up so that 2-3x per lecture, the students would solve a short problem related to what they just learned. This was done either in small groups or alone, and asking the TAs for help (me) was encouraged. I would answer 10-20 student questions on average per lecture, guiding the students towards the correct answer without outright telling them. Additionally, I observed students during tests/quizzes to ensure the absence of cheating. I also graded many of the test/quizzes and assignments. On occasion, at the teaching professor's request, I would lead the lecture in their place.

The lectures of a single class were held multiple times per week. I aided lectures three to six times per week.
