Welcome! I'm Alexander Navarre, and I'm glad you've found my website. This is where you can learn more about me and my accomplishments. Here's a quick overview: I am a recently graduated PhD in physics. I specialized in observational astrophysics: cleaning, analyzing, and explaining the data from instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The majority of my analysis and visualization work was done in Python, using libraries like Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib. I have presented my work (orally and poster-based) at conferences all around the world. I am no stranger to formal, rigorous writing, having written both papers and grant/telescope-time proposals. And I highly value the opportunities to mentor junior collaborators. --- This is just the tip of the iceberg though. Please explore the rest of the website to learn more!

**Image Description**: Six astronomical fields with gravitational lensing. The object(s) of interest in each field are located with yellow bars, and have zoomed-in cutouts. These are the objects I studied in depth in my PhD thesis.
