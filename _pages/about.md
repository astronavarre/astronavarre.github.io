Welcome! I'm Alexander Navarre, and I'm glad you're here. This site is a space where I share my work, projects, and passionsâ€”from astrophysics to data science. Whether you're here to explore my projects, connect, or just learn more about what I do, I hope you find something that sparks your interest. Feel free to look around and reach out if you'd like to connect!
