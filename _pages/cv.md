Work experience
======
* May 2024 - August 2024: **Postdoctoral Researcher** \
Postdoctoral Researcher under the astrophysics research group led by Professor Matthew Bayliss. Contributed to the research goals of the SGAS collaboration.
  * Developed state-of-the-art Python code to model distorted astronomical objects.
  * Performed quality assurance by testing code output across 5 different astronomical fields.
  * Discovered and documented critical limitations of the code for data of specific quality.
  * Authored the first official usage guide on the above-mentioned software.
  * Created install and use guides for multiple research softwares for junior and future group members.

* October 2019 - May 2024: **Graduate Researcher Assistant** \
Graduate Student Researcher under the astrophysics research group led by Professor Matthew Bayliss. Completed a PhD in physics with a concentration in astrophysics. Presented work at multiple conferences domestic and abroad.
  * Conducted extensive Bayesian analysis on Hubble Space Telescope Data to estimate physical properties of galaxies.
  * Developed morphological models of bright galaxies to separate their light profiles from fainter objects of interest.
  * Wrote over 6000 lines of custom python code to analyze spectra and images, visualizing insights with matplotlib for publications.
  * Published a research paper as first author in the Astrophysical Journal.

* August 2018 - January 2020: **Graduate Teaching Assistant** \
Teaching Assistant for introductory physics lectures, labs, and discussion sections. See [Teaching](https://astronavarre.github.io/teaching)
  * Led discussion sections for 20+ students 3x per week to enhance understanding of class material and promote group problem-solving.
  * Conducted laboratory classes for 30+ students on classical mechanics with physical demonstrations to teach proper scientific practices.
  * Assisted lecturers by providing one-on-one student support during class.

* January 2015 - May 2024: **Undergraduate Research Assistant** \
Undergraduate Student Researcher under the astrophysics research groups led by Professors Jeffrey Filippini and Joaquin Vieira. Aided in many smaller research tasks across a variety of subjects.
  * Designed and created jigs for building and testing a balloon-borne telescope on the SPIDER 2 project.
  * Aided in the physical monitoring of the telescope during cryogenic tests.
  * Analyzed 100+ astronomical fields for evidence of newly discovered, gravitationally-lensed quasars.
