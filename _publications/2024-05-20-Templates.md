excerpt: 'This paper uses JWST and AMLA to characterize the gravitational-lensing system SPT0418-47, which includes a lensed image of a dusty, star-forming galaxy and an associated companion. The calculated physical separations, redshifts, and evidence of tidal features indicate that these galaxies are interacting. Interestingly, the star-formation rates and stellar masses of both galaxies indicate that their interaction has not noticibly elevated the star-formation level.'

We present JWST and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) imaging for the lensing system
SPT0418−47, which includes a strongly lensed, dusty, star-forming galaxy at redshift z = 4.225 and an associated
multiply imaged companion. The JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging observations presented in this paper were
acquired as part of the Early Release Science program Targeting Extremely Magnified Panchromatic Lensed Arcs
and Their Extended Star formation (TEMPLATES). This data set provides robust mutiwavelength detections of
stellar light in both the main (SPT0418A) and companion (SPT0418B) galaxies, while the ALMA detection of [C II]
emission confirms that SPT0418B lies at the same redshift as SPT0418A. We infer that the projected physical
separation of the two galaxies is 4.42 ± 0.05 kpc. We derive total magnifications of μ = 29 ± 1 and μ = 4.1 ± 0.7 for
SPT0418A and SPT0418B, respectively. We use both PROSPECTOR and CIGALE to derive stellar masses. We find
that SPT0418A has a stellar mass of $$M_{\odot} = 3.4_{-0.6}^{+1.1} \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}$$ from PROSPECTOR or $$M_{\odot} = 1.5 ± 0.3 × 10^{10} M_{\odot}$$ from
CIGALE. The stellar mass ratio of SPT0418A and SPT0418B is roughly between 4 and 7 (\\(4.2^{+1.6}_{-1.9}\\) for PROSPECTOR
and 7.5 ± 3.7 for CIGALE). We see evidence of extended structure associated with SPT0418A that is suggestive of a
tidal feature. These features, along with the close projected proximity, imply that the system is interacting.
Interestingly, the star formation rates and stellar masses of both galaxies are consistent with the main sequence of
star-forming galaxies at this epoch, indicating that this ongoing interaction has not noticeably elevated the star
formation levels.
