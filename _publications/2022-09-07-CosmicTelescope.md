excerpt: 'This paper is a gravitational lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster PSZ1 G311.65-18.48. This cluster lenses the one of the brightest-known lensed galaxies: The Sunburst Arc. The Sunburst Arc, as well as 14 additional lensed galaxies in the field, are identified and characterized to constrain the lensing model. Additionally, the paper argues that an unusual clump of light in the Sunburst Arc is not a transient event.'

We present a strong-lensing analysis of the cluster PSZ1 G311.65−18.48, based on Hubble Space Telescope
imaging, archival VLT/MUSE spectroscopy, and Chandra X-ray data. This cool-core cluster (z = 0.443) lenses the
brightest lensed galaxy known, dubbed the “Sunburst Arc” (z = 2.3703), a Lyman continuum (LyC) emitting
galaxy multiply imaged 12 times. We identify in this field 14 additional strongly lensed galaxies to constrain a
strong-lens model and report secure spectroscopic redshifts of four of them. We measure a projected cluster core
mass of M(<250 kpc) = $$2.93^{0.01}_{-0.02} \times 10^14 M_{\odot}$$. The two least magnified but complete images of the Sunburst Arc’s
source galaxy are magnified by ∼13×, while the LyC clump is magnified by ∼4–80×. We present time delay
predictions and conclusive evidence that a discrepant clump in the Sunburst Arc, previously claimed to be a
transient, is not variable, thus strengthening the hypothesis that it results from an exceptionally high magnification.
A source plane reconstruction and analysis of the Sunburst Arc finds its physical size to be 1 × 2 kpc and that it is
resolved in three distinct directions in the source plane, 0°, 40°, and 75° (east of north). We place an upper limit of
r $$\lesssim$$ 50 pc on the source plane size of unresolved clumps and r $$\lesssim$$ 32 pc for the LyC clump. Finally, we report that
the Sunburst Arc is likely in a system of two or more galaxies separated by $$\lesssim$$6 kpc in projection. Their interaction
may drive star formation and could play a role in the mechanism responsible for the leaking LyC radiation
