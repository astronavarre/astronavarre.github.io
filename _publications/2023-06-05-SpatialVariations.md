title: "Spatial variations in aromatic hydrocarbon emission in a dust-rich galaxy"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2023-06-05-SpatialVariations
excerpt: 'This paper studies Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs): large orangic molecules that trace the dust that regulares interstellar gas cooling. With the launch of JWST, our ability to resolve infrared galaxy features at high redshift (in the early universe) is highly increased. This paper presents spatially-resolved PAH spectral features. It finds order-of-magnitude variations in the PAH feature strength across the galaxy, suggesting either physical offsets in the PAH distribution or wide variations in the local ultraviolet radiatino field.'

Dust grains absorb half of the radiation emitted by stars throughout the history of the
universe, re-emitting this energy at infrared wavelengths.$$^{1-3}$$ Polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) are large organic molecules that trace millimeter-size dust grains and
regulate the cooling of the interstellar gas within galaxies.$$^{4,5}$$ Observations of PAH features
in very distant galaxies have been difficult due to the limited sensitivity and wavelength
coverage of previous infrared telescopes.$$^{6,7}$$ Here we present JWST observations that detect
the 3.3μm PAH feature in a galaxy observed less than 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang.
The high equivalent width of the PAH feature indicates that star formation, rather than
black hole accretion, dominates the infrared emission throughout the galaxy. The light
from PAH molecules, large dust grains, and stars and hot dust are spatially distinct from
one another, leading to order-of-magnitude variations in the PAH equivalent width and the
ratio of PAH to total infrared luminosity across the galaxy. The spatial variations we
observe suggest either a physical offset between the PAHs and large dust grains or wide
variations in the local ultraviolet radiation field. Our observations demonstrate that
differences in the emission from PAH molecules and large dust grains are a complex result
of localized processes within early galaxies.
