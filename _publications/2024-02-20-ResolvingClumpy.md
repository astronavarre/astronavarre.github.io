excerpt: 'This paper studies a set of six strongly-lensed Lyman-Alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) at redshifts ~ 4-5. Through the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging, this paper calculates esimates of the stellar masses, stellar population ages, and amounts of dust. These properties are consistent with young stellar populations that create Lyman-Alpha. Narrowband Lyman-Alpha imaging indicates these galaxies are non-interacting (not merging galaxies). The paper finds two broad camps of Lyman-Alpha spatial distributions, clumpy and extended. A suggestive trend is found in that the youngest stellar populations in the sample are clumpy while the older populations are extended.'
