excerpt: 'This paper studies a set of six strongly-lensed Lyman-Alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) at redshifts ~ 4-5. Through the analysis of Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope imaging, this paper calculates esimates of the stellar masses, stellar population ages, and amounts of dust. These properties are consistent with young stellar populations that create Lyman-Alpha. Narrowband Lyman-Alpha imaging indicates these galaxies are non-interacting (not merging galaxies). The paper finds two broad camps of Lyman-Alpha spatial distributions, clumpy and extended. A suggestive trend is found in that the youngest stellar populations in the sample are clumpy while the older populations are extended.'

We present six strongly gravitationally lensed Lyα emitters (LAEs) at z ∼ 4–5 with Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) narrowband imaging isolating Lyα. Through complex radiative transfer Lyα encodes information about the
spatial distribution and kinematics of the neutral hydrogen upon which it scatters. We investigate the galaxy
properties and Lyα morphologies of our sample. Many previous studies of high-redshift LAEs have been limited in
Lyα spatial resolution. In this work we take advantage of high-resolution Lyα imaging boosted by lensing
magnification, allowing us to probe subgalactic scales that are otherwise inaccessible at these redshifts. We use
broadband imaging from HST (rest-frame UV) and Spitzer (rest-frame optical) in spectral energy distribution
fitting, providing estimates of the stellar masses ($$∼10^{8}–10^{9} M_{\odot}$$), stellar population ages ($$t_{50}$$ < 40 Myr), and
amounts of dust ($$A_{V}$$ ∼ 0.1–0.6, statistically consistent with zero). We employ nonparametric star formation
histories to probe the young stellar populations which create the Lyα. We also examine the offsets between the
Lyα and stellar continuum, finding small upper limits of offsets (<0.1") consistent with studies of low-redshift
LAEs, indicating our galaxies are not interacting or merging. Finally, we find a bimodality in our sample’s Lyα
morphologies: clumpy and extended. We find a suggestive trend: our LAEs with clumpy Lyα are generally
younger than the LAEs with extended Lyα, suggesting a possible correlation with age.
