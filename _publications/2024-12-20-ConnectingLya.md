excerpt: 'This paper is a study of the Lyman-Continuum (LyC) and Lyman-Alpha (Lya) emission of the Sunburst Arc: one of the brightest-known gravitationally-lensed galaxies. Strong correlations are found between the LyC escape fraction and mulitple Lya measures such as peak separation and equivalent width. A possible complex geometry of neutral hydrogen is proposed to explain the differences in the Lya/LyC spectra across the sunburst arc. The study underscores the importance of resolving small physical scales to reliably explain Lya and LyC escape.'
