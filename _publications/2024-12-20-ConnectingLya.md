excerpt: 'This paper is a study of the Lyman-Continuum (LyC) and Lyman-Alpha (Lya) emission of the Sunburst Arc: one of the brightest-known gravitationally-lensed galaxies. Strong correlations are found between the LyC escape fraction and mulitple Lya measures such as peak separation and equivalent width. A possible complex geometry of neutral hydrogen is proposed to explain the differences in the Lya/LyC spectra across the sunburst arc. The study underscores the importance of resolving small physical scales to reliably explain Lya and LyC escape.'

We investigate the Lyα and Lyman continuum (LyC) properties of the Sunburst Arc, a z = 2.37 gravitationally
lensed galaxy with a multiply imaged, compact region leaking LyC and a triple-peaked Lyα profile indicating
direct Lyα escape. Non-LyC-leaking regions show a redshifted Lyα peak, a redshifted and central Lyα peak, or a
triple-peaked Lyα profile. We measure the properties of the Lyα profile from different regions of the galaxy using
R ∼ 5000 Magellan/Magellan Echellette spectra. We compare the Lyα spectral properties to LyC and narrowband
Lyα maps from Hubble Space Telescope imaging to explore the subgalactic Lyα−LyC connection. We find strong
correlations (Pearson correlation coefficient r > 0.6) between the LyC escape fraction ( \\(f_{esc}^{LyC}\\)) and Lyα (1) peak
separation \\(v_{sep}\\), (2) ratio of the minimum flux density between the redshifted and blueshifted Lyα peaks to
continuum flux density \\(\frac{f_{min}}{f_{cont}}\\), and (3) equivalent width. We favor a complex H I geometry to explain the Lyα
profiles from non-LyC-leaking regions and suggest two H I geometries that could diffuse and/or rescatter the
central Lyα peak from the LyC-leaking region into our sight line across transverse distances of several hundred
parsecs. Our results emphasize the complexity of Lyα radiative transfer and its sensitivity to the anisotropies of H I
gas on subgalactic scales. Large differences in the physical scales on which we observe spatially variable direct-
escape Lyα, blueshifted Lyα, and escaping LyC photons in the Sunburst Arc underscore the importance of
resolving the physical scales that govern Lyα and LyC escape.
