excerpt: 'This paper studies a small region of The Sunburst Arc, one of the brightest-known gravitationally-lensed galaxies. The small region uniquely has high Lyman-Continuum (LyC, ionizing radiation) escape: a critical component to understanding star-formation based Reionization models. Spatially resolved analysis characterizes the region as being consistent with approximately "pure" stellar light. This provides evidence for pencil-beam LyC escape: where anisotropic processes "poke" ionized channels through the surrounding gas, letting radiation escape reletively unimpeded.'
